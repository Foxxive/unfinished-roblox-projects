# unfinished-roblox-projects

Honestly way too many of my unfinished ROBLOX games that I have decided to release for free

Most of these games are any i'm either not proud of or had no motivation in finishing, but someone out there might.

Then there's the occasional game that was made for testing, like the maze algorithim for example

# FAQ: (nobody actually asks anything but it looks professional)
**Q:** Do I have to give credit?

**A:** Credit would be nice, but it's not really necessary, after all this is all stuff I've made free

**Q:** Can I publish these games?

**A:** Yeah, do whatever. Make 'em your own

**Q:** Can I sell them?

**A:** no.
