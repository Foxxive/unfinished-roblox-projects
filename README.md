# unfinished-roblox-projects
Hey y'all! You're probably here from my youtube channel or Discord server. If you're not, welcome!

Here I have a bunch of unfinished ROBLOX games that I have decided to make Open Sourced for you guys to edit to your liking.
What exactly are these ROBLOX games? Well they're just games I left unfinished or never had time to work on or lost interest in them. 

FAQ:

Q: Do I have to give credit?
A: I would prefer if you did so, but it is not mandatory. :)

Q: Can I publish these games?
A: Yes! You can 100% publish them and make them your own. Go nuts!

Q: Can I sell them?
A: no
